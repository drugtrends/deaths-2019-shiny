ICD-10 uses the terminology “amphetamines” to refer to the drug class that includes “methamphetamine”, as well as MDMA (ecstasy) and other pharmaceutical stimulants but excludes cocaine. *Amphetamine-induced* deaths refer to deaths where amphetamines (as defined by ICD-10 terminology) were considered to be the underlying cause of death. Causes of death data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are not final and subject to further revisions process; data for 2015 and earlier years are final. Small numbers of death have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.

Note: Results by sex unavailable due to small numbers.
