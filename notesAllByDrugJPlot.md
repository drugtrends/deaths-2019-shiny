Deaths directly attributable to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis. Results presented here include alcohol only as a substance present in drug-induced deaths.

Small numbers of death have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.

Causes of death data for 2017 and 2018 are preliminary and subject to a further revisions process; data for 2016 are subject to a revisions process; data for 2015 and earlier years are final.

Presented here are drug-induced deaths where a substance from a broader drug class (in CAPITAL LETTERS) or particular drug type (in lowercase letters) was present in drug-induced death. Note, multiple drugs may be involved in one death.

Refer to Notes tab for examples of drugs commonly assigned to each category.
