These data are provided by the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au/) (ABS) using data from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Changes in data coding and collection have occurred over the time period reported. 

The ABS undertake a revision process for coroner-certified deaths over a 3-year period; accordingly, data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are not final. Causes of death data for 2017 and 2018 are preliminary and subject to two further revisions; data for 2016 are revised and subject to another revision. These figures should be viewed in conjunction with the ABS [Explanatory Notes 50-58](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3303.0Explanatory%20Notes12016?OpenDocument).

In addition to the revision process, the ABS undertook further processing improvements from 2008 onwards. For both open and closed cases, the ABS increasingly use additional information from the NCIS (e.g. autopsy, police and toxicology reports) where available to apply more specific cause of death codes. These processing improvements are likely to have an impact on the number of drug-induced deaths reported from 2008 onwards. 

Causes of death are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (hereafter ‘ICD’). In 2014, the ABS implemented IRIS, an automatic system for coding multiple causes of death and selecting the underlying cause of death. The World Health Organization updates and coding practice changes associated with dependence syndromes as an underlying cause of death have also been implemented by ABS. Impacts on the data from 2013 onwards are described in more detail in the ABS [Technical Note 1, Causes of Death Australia 2013](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3303.0Technical%20Note12013?opendocument&tabname=Notes).  At the time of publication of this document, latest statistics on causes of death for Australia, including drug-induced deaths, are presented in the ABS publication [Causes of Death, Australia, 2018 (cat. no. 3303.0)](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3303.0Main+Features12018?OpenDocument).

It should also be noted that availability of additional information within the NCIS varies by jurisdiction; improvements to data collection are likely to be applied differentially across jurisdictions. 

In our presentation of drug-induced deaths in Australia, small numbers of deaths have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation. 

Please read our accompanying [methodology document](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/resource/trends-drug-induced-deaths-australia-1997-2018) for further information. 

### Terminology

**Underlying cause of death (UCOD)** is the disease or condition which initiated the sequence of events resulting in death. There can be only one underlying cause of death. 

**Associated causes of death (ACOD)** are any other diseases or conditions that contributed to the death but were not the underlying cause and are listed on the death certificate.  

**Multiple causes of death (MCOD)** include all causes (both underlying and associated causes), diseases and conditions reported on the death certificate. For deaths where the underlying cause was identified as an external cause (for example, injury or poisoning, etc.), multiple causes include circumstances of injury and the nature of injury as well as any other conditions reported on the death certificate. 

Deaths are considered **‘drug-induced deaths’** if they are directly attributable to drug use (e.g. drug toxicity/overdose is the underlying cause of death). They are considered **‘drug-related deaths’** where drugs played a contributory role (i.e., listed as an associated cause of death) and the death was attributable to another cause (e.g. motor vehicle accident). 

### Intent

As part of the coronial investigation of drug-related deaths, the coroner assigns the manner of intent to these deaths where there is sufficient information. The ICD-10 coding incorporates codes for the following categories of intent: 

**1. Accidental intent,** where the coroner determines the manner/intent of the injury or poisoning which led to death was accidental; 

**2. Intentional,** where the coroner determines that the manner/intent of the injury or poisoning which led to death was purposeful; and 

**3. Undetermined,** where there was insufficient information for the coroner to make a determination on the intent. 

**4. Other,** where intent could not be classified to any of the above categories. Numbers in this category is very small.

We have disaggregated by intent type where numbers are sufficient to protect confidentiality of individuals.
