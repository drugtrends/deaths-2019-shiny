These figures shows opioid-induced deaths with other drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines, alcohol) contributing to the death. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause. Causes of death data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are not final and subject to further revisions process; data for 2015 and earlier years are final. Small numbers of death have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.
