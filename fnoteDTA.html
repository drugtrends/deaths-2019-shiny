<small><p>Deaths directly attributable to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis. Results presented here include alcohol only as a substance present in drug-induced deaths. Causes of death data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 are not final and subject to further revisions process; data for 2016 and earlier years are final. Data with numbers of deaths between 1 and 5 have been removed and this can be visible as gaps in the data series. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.</p><p>Presented here are drug-induced deaths where a substance from a broader drug class (in CAPITAL LETTERS) or particular drug type (in lowercase letters) was present in drug-induced death. Note, multiple drugs may be involved in one death. Refer to Notes tab for examples of drugs commonly assigned to each category.</p></small>
