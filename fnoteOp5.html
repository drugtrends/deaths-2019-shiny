<small><p>These data refer to deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause of death. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2018 and 2019 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2017 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2016 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been removed and this can be visible as gaps in the data series.</p>
<p><i>Natural and semi-synthetic opioids</i> include morphine, oxycodone and codeine (ICD-10 Code T40.2). <i>Synthetic opioids</i> include fentanyl, tramadol and pethidine (ICD-10 Code T40.4). <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i> comprise opioid-induced deaths that are not attributed to specific opioids (ICD-10 Code T40.6).</p>
<p>Data on <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i> are not available for <i>Intentional intent</i> and <i>Undetermined intent</i> due to small numbers.</p>
<p>Plots also showing "<i>All drug-induced deaths</i>" display data on drug-induced deaths involving the corresponding opioid type. For your information, these data on drug-induced deaths are also shown under the plots for "<i>Drug-induced deaths by drug, jurisdiction and sex</i>".</p></small>
