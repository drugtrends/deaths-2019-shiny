These figures show opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to *Illicit opioids* (predominantly heroin), opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to *Pharmaceutical opioids* (i.e. natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids), and opioid-induced deaths that were attributed to both *Illicit* and *Pharmaceutical opioids*. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause. Causes of death data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are not final and subject to further revisions process; data for 2015 and earlier years are final. Small numbers of death have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.

Note: Data unavailable for *Intentional* intent for *Other and unspecified opioids*.
