<small><p>Deaths directly related to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2018 and 2019 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2017 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2016 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been removed and this can be visible as gaps in the data series.</p>
<p>2009 and 2010 data were coded using the Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC) (ABS cat no 1216.0). 2011 data onwards is coded using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) (ABS cat. no. 1270.0.55.001) to Statistical Area 2 (SA2) level. Correspondence was applied to the 2009 and 2010 data by ABS to obtain corresponding ASGS codes, which would have introduced some inaccuracies and should be considered when interpreting the data. We applied ABS correspondence between ASGS at SA2 level and remoteness area to derive number of deaths in each remoteness area. Number of deaths in the data were rounded to the nearest integer. Refer to the ABS website for more information on geography standards and correspondences.</p>
<p>NOTE: Estimates by remoteness area for Northern Territory, Tasmania, and Australian Capital Territory are suppressed as numbers are small. Estimates in 10-year age groups are not shown for <i>Remote and Very Remote</i> regions due to small numbers. Percentages by remoteness area are only shown for <i>All ages</i> and the <i>15 to 64</i> years age group.</p></small>
