A [Tabulation list](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3303.0Appendix22018?opendocument&tabname=Notes&prodno=3303.0&issue=2018&num=&view=) of ICD-codes to identify causes of death attributable to drug-induced mortality was developed by the ABS based on a drug-induced death tabulation created by United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We have adopted these codes for our definition of all drug-induced deaths as given below. Deaths related to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis.

### Definition of intent among drug-induced deaths


| **Intent** | **UCOD** | | **ACOD** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Accidental**          | X40-X44             | with | any |
|                         | Drug-induced deaths &nbsp; | with &nbsp; | X40-X44 |
| **All intents**         | Drug-induced deaths |                    |   |

### Remoteness area

Remoteness area by place of usual residence is mainly derived from Mesh Blocks and in a small number of cases from Statistical Area Level 2 based on the ASGS 2016 boundaries. Please refer to ABS for details on [remoteness structure classifications](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/remoteness+structure).
