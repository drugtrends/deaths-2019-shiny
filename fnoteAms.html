<small><p>ICD-10 uses the terminology “amphetamines” to refer to the drug class that includes “methamphetamine”, as well as MDMA (ecstasy) and other pharmaceutical stimulants but excludes cocaine. <i>Amphetamine-induced</i> deaths refer to deaths where amphetamines (as defined by ICD-10 terminology) were considered to be the underlying cause of death. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2018 and 2019 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2017 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2016 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been removed and this can be visible as gaps in the data series.</p>
<p>Plots also showing "<i>All drug-induced deaths</i>" display data on drug-induced deaths involving amphetamines. For your information, these data on drug-induced deaths involving amphetamines are also shown under the plots for "<i>Drug-induced deaths by drug and age</i>".</p>
<p>NOTE: Data by sex and for the <i>65 to 74</i> years and <i>75 to 84</i> years age groups are unavailable due to small numbers.</p></small>
