<small><p>These figures show opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Illicit opioids</i> (predominantly heroin), opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Pharmaceutical opioids</i> (i.e. natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids), and opioid-induced deaths that were attributed to both <i>Illicit and Pharmaceutical opioids</i>. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause.</p><p>Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2018 and 2019 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2017 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2016 and earlier years are final. Data with numbers of deaths between 1 and 5 have been removed and this can be visible as gaps in the data series. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.</p><p>NOTE: Data unavailable for <i>Intentional intent</i> for <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i>.</p></small>
