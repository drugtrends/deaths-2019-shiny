<p>These figures show opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Illicit opioids</i> (predominantly heroin), opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Pharmaceutical opioids</i> (i.e. natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids), and opioid-induced deaths that were attributed to both <i>Illicit and Pharmaceutical opioids</i>. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Causes of death data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are not final and subject to further revisions process; data for 2015 and earlier years are final. Small numbers of death have been randomly assigned to protect the confidentiality of individuals. Zero values have not been affected by confidentialisation.</p>
<p>NOTE: Data unavailable for <i>Intentional</i> intent for <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i>.</p>
